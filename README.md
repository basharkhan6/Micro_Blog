# Micro_Blog
A small micro-blogging platform with REST and Basic Security where users can post and interact (upvote, downvote, comment) with posts from other users.

### Functional Requirements
1. Users can create new posts.
2. Users can view posts of other users.
3. Users can comment on posts of other users.
4. Users can upvote/downvote posts of other users.
5. Users can view comments of a particular post.
6. Users can see upvote and downvote counts of a particular post.

### Technical Requirements
1. System will allow only a single upvote/downvote per post for a user. If a user downvotes
previously upvoted post, that upvote should be replaced with a downvote and vice-versa.
2. System should comply with REST architecture.
